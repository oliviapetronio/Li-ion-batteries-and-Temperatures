Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are prevalent today in society with their usage in rechargeable batteries such as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage. Many of the companies including Tesla (Tesla Model S), Nissan (Nissan Leaf), and NASA (hybrid- electric Boeing 787) are using Li-ion batteries for their product. However, Li-ion batteries have a finite life span. Under higher temperatures, higher charge rates, or other conditions, the life span of lithium-ion batteries shortens. We used L2 regularization (Ridge) method to demonstrate the polynomial regression of lithium-ion batteriesâ€™ performance, based on the data provided by Catenaro and Onori.
